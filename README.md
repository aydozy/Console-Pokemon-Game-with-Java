# _Pokemon Game_ 

As a Pokemon lover, I developed a console game with "Java", which is the language I am currently learning and using effectively.

In this game, which aims to reinforce the learned information, the features of OOP are used extensively.
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Arrays
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

## _How to Play ?_ ðŸŽ®

This game, played by 2 people, has 3 characters:

1- Pikachu âš¡

2- Charmander ðŸ”¥

3- Bulbasaur ðŸ¥¬

After choosing a character, players will be greeted with 3 options to choose their attack style:

1-Attack

2-Special (Each character has a special power)

3-Heal

It is a game that can last 2 rounds.
